    "question": "A company makes forecasts each quarter to decide how to optimize operations to meet expected demand. The company uses ML models to make these forecasts.\nAn AI practitioner is writing a report about the trained ML models to pro
vide transparency and explainability to company stakeholders.\nWhat should the AI practitioner include in the report to meet the transparency and explainability requirements?",
    "options": [
      "Code for model training",
      "Partial dependence plots (PDPs)",
      "Sample data for training",
      "Model convergence tables"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Partial dependence plots (PDPs)",
    "explanation": "Partial dependence plots (PDPs) illustrate the marginal effect of one or two features on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model, providing transparency by showing how predictions change as feature values vary, whi
ch helps stakeholders understand model behavior.",
