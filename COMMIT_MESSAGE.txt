Fix: Enable dynamic question bank loading on GitHub Pages

## Problem
Question banks from the `bank` folder were not appearing when deployed to GitHub Pages because the application relied on server-side API endpoints that don't work with static hosting.

## Solution
Implemented a hybrid approach that works in both development and production:

### Build-Time Processing
- Modified `script/build-static.ts` to copy all bank JSON files to `dist/public/bank/`
- Generate `manifest.json` with metadata for all question banks
- Ensure all banks are included in the static build

### Client-Side Fallback
- Updated `client/src/data/sample-questions.ts` to try API first, then fall back to static files
- Load banks from `/bank/manifest.json` and individual files when API is unavailable
- Seamless experience in both development (with server) and production (GitHub Pages)

### Files Changed
- script/build-static.ts - Added bank folder processing
- client/src/data/sample-questions.ts - Added static file fallback
- bank/aws_ai_practitioner_bank.json - Normalized format (105 questions)
- bank/example-questions.json - Added example bank (3 questions)

### Files Created
- bank/README.md - Question bank format guide
- DEPLOYMENT.md - Comprehensive deployment guide
- GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md - Detailed fix documentation
- CHANGES.md - Complete change log
- verify-setup.sh - Setup verification script
- script/normalize-bank.ts - JSON format normalization tool

### Features
✅ Automatic loading of all JSON files from bank folder
✅ Works on GitHub Pages without server
✅ Backward compatible with development mode
✅ Easy to add new question banks (just add JSON files)
✅ Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions

### Testing
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [x] Bank files copied to dist/public/bank/
- [x] manifest.json generated correctly
- [x] Local testing works (npx serve dist/public)
- [x] Question banks load in browser
- [x] Both dev and prod modes work

### Deployment
Simply push to main branch - GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Build the static site
2. Include all bank files
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

See DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed instructions.
